    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cup strawberries</li>
        <li>1 small banana</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk of choice</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use frozen banana and frozen strawberries. Add all ingredients to your high speed blender or let the fruit defrost for a bit and blend with an immersion blender. Blend until there are no chunks of fruit left. I needed to open the blender, scoop and blend again to get everyhing blended.</li>
        <li>You can experiment add less milk to make the ice cream thicker, but this is perfect for serving immediately.</li>
